<p class="main">Editor's note: In a series of reports titled "Legacies of the Games", China Daily explores changes brought to the country by the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. This is the fifth and last in the series.
    With follow-up plans ready to kick in, venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are expected to remain busy as organizers and venue owners introduce legacy projects to keep facilities running profitably and sustainably.
    More than a month after her gold-winning performance at the Winter Olympics, freestyle skiing superstar Gu Ailing last week revisited Shougang Industrial Park, where she won the freeski Big Air event on Feb 8.
    Her return again focused attention on the park, which reopened to the public after the Games for sightseeing, exercise and leisure activities.
    Gu was invited as an ambassador to take part in a charity running event organized at the foot of the giant slope she hurtled down to perform stunning aerial tricks during the Olympics.</p>
<div id="d1">Global cooperation on 6G research should be accelerated as the next few years are crucial for determining the direction of next-generation wireless technology, according to officials and experts.

    While there is no universally accepted definition of 6G, the technology is expected to have far lower latency, higher speeds and more bandwidth than 5G.
    
    The technology supports the integration of space, air

    Xiang Libin, Ministry of Science and Technology, said that the vision for 6G is still in its infancy and there is no consensus yet on key technologies.

The comments came after Chinese telecom company Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet (USA) LLC on Wednesday received an order from the US Federal Communications Commission that revoked their authority to provide relevant telecom services in the US. The ministry said in a statement that it strongly opposes such decision and urged the FCC to treat Chinese telecommunications companies fairly and in a nondiscriminatory way. "China will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies," MIIT said. According to the ministry, Pacific Networks Corp and ComNet (USA) LLC have been operating in the US for several years. They have always abided by US laws and regulations, and provided high-quality services to many customers in the US in accordance with commercial principles. The MIIT said the FCC revoked their section 214 authority without listing any facts to support the alleged violations of the laws. It is an unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies by further overgeneralizing the national security concept and abusing state power. Such practices seriously damaged the US business environment and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and global consumers, including US users, the ministry added.</div>
